# Cluster-scripts
A collection of various scripts for submitting computational chemistry jobs to
supercomputing clusters provided by various institutions.

For now, only the OCCIGEN collection is fully usable.

# Occigen
This script collections allows the user to easily setup a working environment
on the OCCIGEN cluster provided by Cines (www.cines.fr). It provides shortcuts
to follow computations as they are running, follow the queue, and submit
Gaussian09 and ADF 2016 computations to either the standard or the shared queue.


# Thorium
A collection modifiable for any pbs-related cluster, but with specific
configuration for our local cluster Thorium.

# LISA
A collection of scripts allowing job submission for Gaussian09 and ADF (for
various versions) on the LISA supercomputer.
This collection is unmaintained and will be removed after some time.
